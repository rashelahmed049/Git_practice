hey buddy how are you, most of the spices are found in South India. Banglaore is the most suitable city in South for a livelihood weather. But the traffic in bangalore is terrible, if you are a bus commuter then its very difficult to maintain a daily routine of travelling. The plus of point of staying in bangalore is that the fast food and fruit juice are at very affordable rate, which is like 3times in my native Guwahati. Aother disadvantage of travelling to native from Bangalore is the airport, which is too far from my pg, it takes almost 2 and half hours to reach airport via bus, so it is also one of the hectic job.
